ISAMBARD is a Python-based framework for structural analysis and rational
design of biomolecules, with a particular focus on parametric modelling of
proteins. It is developed and maintained by members of the [Woolfson group, University of Bristol](http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/org/woolfson/index.html).

### Citing ISAMBARD
Any publication arising from use of the ISAMBARD software package should cite the following reference:

[Wood CW *et al* (2017) ISAMBARD: an open-source computational environment for biomolecular analysis, modelling and design. *Bioinformatics*, **33**, 3043-50](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btx352)

## Installation

ISAMBARD can be installed straight from PyPI using `pip`:

```
pip install isambard
```
Or if you want to try an experimental build (you'll need a C compiler), download
from GitHub either by downloading the zipped file or cloning, then navigate to
the ISAMBARD folder and type:

```
pip install .
```

## External Programs

If you want to add side chains to your designs, you need to have [Scwrl4](
http://dunbrack.fccc.edu/scwrl4/) installed and available on your system path. 

## Quick Start

Wanting to delve a bit deeper? Take a look at the [docs](
https://woolfson-group.github.io/isambard/) to find out more of the features in
ISAMBARD, or just take a look through the code base and hack around. Feel free
to contact us through email or the issues if you get stuck.

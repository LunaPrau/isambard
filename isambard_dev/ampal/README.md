# The AMPAL Framework

This folder contains code for the AMPAL framework, which is used to represent biomolecular structure in ISAMBARD. AMPAL classes for new biomolecules should be added here to a file specifically for that molecule type. If a new molecule class is added, a corresponding filter should be added to the PDBParser.

The `specifications` module is also included in this directory as specifications directly inherit from the AMPAL framework.

Installation
============

Basic Install
-------------

You can install ISAMBARD from pip:

``pip install ampal``

Installing from Source
----------------------

If installing from source by downloading/cloning this repository, navigating to
the folder and typing:

``pip install .``

ISAMBARD uses Cython, so if you're installing from source make sure you have it
installed. Furthermore, you'll also need a C compiler, which will be available
by default on Mac and Linux, but on Windows you'll need to install
the `Visual C++ Build Tools <http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools>`_.
